title: Biography
bio: Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student investigating how infants discover, explore and learn the speech sounds of their first language. To do this, I use techniques from acoustic phonetics, Bayesian statistics, and meta-science. If you are interested in having a chat, I'd love to hear from you!
